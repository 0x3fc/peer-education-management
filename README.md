# Introduction

Peer education is a program which aims to encourage students in the college to help each other with their academic problems. By helping others, peer educators themselves can consolidate knowledge learnt in the past. The program is also an ideal platform for making new friends. Except for academic problems, students can seek help for their daily problems. This repo provides a tool for creating, storing, and retrieving information about peer educators. Peer educators are allowed to check schedules, take attendance, and write journals through this system.
